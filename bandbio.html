                century. The program ran for two seasons, after which Dolenz made sporadic appearances on network television shows and pursued his education. Dolenz went to Ulysses S. Grant High School in Valley Glen, Los Angeles, California, and graduated
                in 1962. In 1964, he was cast as Ed in the episode "Born of Kings and Angels" of the NBC education drama series, Mr. Novak, starring James Franciscus as an idealistic Los Angeles teacher. Dolenz was attending college in Los Angeles when
                he was hired for the "drummer" role in NBC's The Monkees.</div><!--info taken from wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micky_Dolen -->

                    with a similar "open, Nordic look," and Stills suggested Tork audition for the part. Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a fictitious pop band in the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom written
                    about the fictitious band. Tork was the oldest member of the group</div><!--info taken from wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tork-->

                    him a copy of the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane boys" so he applied for the job. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing indifferent when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool
                    hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered "Wool Hat", and called Nesmith back.</div><!--info taken from wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Nesmith-->

                    signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer". The DVD
                    release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability,
                    it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Mostly playing tambourine
                    or maracas, Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards</div><!--info taken from wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Jones_(musician)-->
