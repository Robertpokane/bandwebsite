<h1> The Monkees  </h1>


<b>One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project</b>.

In this, the first milestone project, I will implamenting what I have learned and what I can do at this early stage of my coding career. 
For this project I had loads of ideas:
<ul>
<li>A live news feed for the <b>Index</b> page </li>
<li>Links to the bands Spotify/youtube/twitter/facebook on every footer</li> 
<li>Album playlists that changed the song list when clicked on on the shopping page</li> 
<li>Monthly news letter subscription</li>
<li>different payment options</li>
<li>audio sampling of songs</li>
<li>online shop with constantly updating merchendise</li>
<li>Automatic update on home page if a new item has added</li>
<li>notice apearing on the top of the home page that all first time orders have an instant 33% discount</li>
<li>Monkees TV show episodes/ clips fromt he show</li>
</ul>

<p>After carefull consideration I have decided on a number of features to include for the opening versions of my project and what can be implimented for the future versions.</p>

<p>For the initial version of my project I have implimented a news setion in the Index page, right now it is filled with Lorem text as to give the band an idea as to what it is going to look like.
from the limited library that I have to hand. I was able to get a few of the songs and almbum covers implimented into the tunes section. Each of the songs has an exerpt from wikipeda beside it to 
give the user a glimse into the history of the piece, beside what we have, as the main attraction the music video of Daydream Believer.

<b>UX</b>

<p> My UX process is a pretty simple one. I start with my end goal and work backwords taking each step as a stepping stone to reach how I shoulld start my project as explaine above. 
My aim was to provide an avenue for fans of the band, long term and new fans, to find out somethibng they didnt previously know about the band. Weither that is through our news feature or through the stories in tunes we always have something to offer.


My focus for the site is to keep the user's attention engaged. this is done in a number of ways. First of all we need a eye catching story to put on the front page, music to stimulate the mind while they read an amusing anecdote abut the piece that they are listening to. where we can then direct them to our shop where sonds, digital and physical can be sold, limited edition merchandise, signed posters
what ever the band wants to sell. We can collect email addresses and Send out a monthly email with Stories, a "this day in History" freature (example on this day 12th June 1967 was the first ever episode of the monkees or Micky Dolenz birthday.) new items available from the shop. Thing like that. </p>

What I aim to achieve:

<b>Jimmy:</b>


"as sombody that was born long after the rise of the monkees, I wanted to get to know what the bad was like what sort of music they making, what the tv show was like, so I naturally gravitated towards the site, 
It has all the information i need, as well as a music, music videos, stories from behind thesceens and more!"

<b>Tommy:</b>


"I grew up listening to the monkees on the radio and watching them on the tv. I have followed there career from the first comedic musical beginings in 1966 until today. The website keeps me updates with everything that is going on today."

<b>Julie:</b>

"I am an avid collecter of music and music memberoilia. I have Such a soft spot for all things Monkee releated. The news letter keeps me up-to-date with sales happening in the store and when there is anything new I can add to my collection "

These are the 3 core user types that I bases my site around, from my <a href="assets/Wireframes/Band website mockup.bmpr">wireframes</a> as a strating point to the stories on the stories on the <a href="tunes.html">Tunes</a> page to the music and Merchandise that will be available on the <a href="shop.html">Shop</a> page

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:


In addition,my plans for the future of this website is to:

<ul>

<li>Have either clips or full episode on the monkees tv show</li>
<li>Have a customisable merchendise page, names, </li>
<li>Run monthly competitions to recieve signed merchandise</li>
<li>Set up a Monthly News letter called "Monkee Around Monthly"</li>

</ul>


Technologies Used

Once I took stock of all the technoliges used for my project I was genuinly surprise at the ever growing list that I amased. 

<ul>

<li>HTML 5 fot the basic lay out and structuer of the site</li>
<li>CSS for the colour and style of the site </li>

<li>Bootstrap for the navigation button style <a target = 'blank'href="https://getbootstrap.com/https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></li>
<li>Jquerry as Bootstrap relays on it <a target = 'blank'href="https://jquery.com">Jquery</a></li>
<li>I used alot of the information on the Code Instatute course allong with all of the music and pictures of the band <a target = 'blank'href="https://codeinstitute.net/">Code Institute</a></li>
<li>LinkedIn learning fort the responsive Iframe for the music video <a target = 'blank' href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/">LinkedIn Learning</a></li>

</u>


In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
